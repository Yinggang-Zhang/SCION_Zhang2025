# Spatial Continuous Integration - Earth Evolution Model
# SCION-modified version for Zhang et al. (2025) Geophysical Research Letters

This code is a modified version of SCION for Zhang et al. (2025) Geophysical Research Letter.

SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing.

The revisions we did here are:
1. the ocean box is splited into two boxes: shelf and interior ocean.
2. Insolation forcing is newly added to the model.

Requies MATLAB.

For more information on running the model see the Guidebook in the documentation folder. For scientific derivaiton see the journal articles listed in the Guidebook.

The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email ygzhang@nigpas.ac.cn or B.Mills@leeds.ac.uk
